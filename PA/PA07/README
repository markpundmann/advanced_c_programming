This program needs to take in a file, open it, invert the image pixels, and save it.  


Reading a BMP file consists of the following steps:

1. Open a binary file for reading.
2. Read the 54-byte header into memory.
//create an image file and assign using -> the values of the header to the image file.  
//This data will be used for edited the file
3. Check that the data in the header is valid (use BMP_checkValid
   given in bmp.c).
4. Allocate space for the image data.
5. Read the image data (which is the file size minus the 54 bytes of
   the header).
6. Close the file.

Editing the image pixels will consist of finding the correct binary values for the pixels and inverting them.  
This consists of removing header and things like that, and switching the RGB values.  
Invertion will simply be: value= absolute(value-255).  

Saving a BMP file is similar:

1. Open a binary file for writing
2. Write the 54-byte header into the file
3. Write the image data into the file (again, the file size from the
   header minus 54 bytes)
4. Close the file.
